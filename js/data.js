                <p>1、Story: In a wooden house in the forest, the protagonist wakes up from his bed and opens the door to find a fire outside, dead animals floating in the river and cracks gradually appearing on the ground. In a panic, he thinks of his grandfather telling him that there is a way to turn back the clock.
                      So he rushed home, found a time warp, and traveled back two hundred years. At this time, people were just starting to develop industry and cut down a lot of wood. Consumption had increased dramatically, and underground mineral deposits were being extensively mined and smelted, leading to deforestation,
                      climate warming and ozone depletion. Thinking of the impact all this would have, he resolved to do something to change the world.</p>

                <p>Girls help girls is a very warm and powerful phrase.
People with similar experiences and feelings are more likely to understand and empathize with each other, and are more able to speak to the
point and help to the point. Compared to men, women are generally more sensitive, more empathetic, more compassionate, and more likely
to express their emotions. Because the gender brings a sense of inferiority is also ubiquitous, by all kinds of open, private and invisible
harassment, was not valued, was denied ability and effort. </p>

                <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
                <p>Facial expressions are an important communication tool for human beings. Through facial expressions, people can recognize the mental state of others, such as happiness, anger, sadness, etc. Facial emotion recognition (FER) is achieved by measuring changes in various body parameters, such as measuring heart rate, eye activity, EEG, etc., or by analyzing facial images. 
                   The latter is popular due to its abundant computational resources and cost-effectiveness. FER studies based on camera inputs can be divided into two groups, conventional methods and methods using neural networks. Conventional FER methods are based on hand-designed features to recognize facial emotions. 
                   The typical process involves detecting regions, extracting features, and then using a pre-trained classifier to recognize facial emotions. With the availability of large datasets, it has become a general approach for computer vision. In the published study, Kim et al. proposed a hybrid model consisting of CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) with the highest performance and accuracy of 78.61%</p>
                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>1、Methods：Convolution, Activation, Pooling, Batch Normalization, Dropout;</p>
                <p>2、Database：The Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) database，inlcuding 28709 training samples and 3589 validation samples;</p>
                <p>3、Results：</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1、Unbalanced data：Of the seven emotions, happy emotions accounted for the highest proportion, about 30% of the total sample. Disgusting emotions were relatively rare, accounting for only 3% of the total sample;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is performed using 10 epochs and performance is evaluated using a validation dataset. The overall accuracy of the trained CNN model is 65%;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2、Balanced data：</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.1、Random undersampling method：Achieved by imblearn API function RandomUnderSampler;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model requires about 40 epochs to converge, with an accuracy of about 40%, which is a 62.5% drop compared to the model using the original images;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.2、Random oversampling method：Achieved by imblearn API function RandomOverSampler;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model requires 5 epochs to converge, with a final accuracy of about 60%;</p>
                <p>4、Training with augmented data: as the input image changes in each epoch, the accuracy is close to 70% for 60 epochs.</p>

                <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
                <p>In this paper, I will use the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as my topic game. It is an open world action-adventure game jointly developed 
                by Monolith Soft and produced by Nintendo. The protagonist Link wakes up in the underground ruins on Hyrule land, chasing the incredible sounds and 
                embarking on an adventure. I will use Gee’s learning principles manipulation and distributed knowledge and cycle of expertise to demonstrate why 
                Zelda is a good video game and how this game can teach players how to play. Then I will support my thesis by referring the article “Play that can 
                Do Good” and Brown’s book Videogames and Education.</p>

                <p>1、James Paul Gee：Beyond characters, good games offer the player intricate, effective, and easy manipulation of the world’s objects, objects which become tools for carrying out the player’s goals; </p>
                <p>2、Adam Eichenbaum, Daphne Bavelier and C. Shawn Green：Creating an environment that encourages users to invest substantial amounts of time in learning and more hours spent on a task means more learning, and video game encourages players to put time in tasks;</p>
                <p>3、Harry J. Brown: Adventure games invite the player to inhabit an imaginary world and, in playing the game, ‘to enact an understanding of that world;</p>
