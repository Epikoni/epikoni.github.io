                <p>9/20/2024 – 3/16/2025，Group of 6</p>
                <h2>Development Tool</h2>
                <p>Github, Perforce, Unity, JIRA</p>
                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>Mob Street is a multiplayer social deception game developed within VRChat, designed to encourage player interaction, deception, and strategy. The game is set in an urban environment where players assume roles as mobsters, aiming to complete their objectives before their opponents. The gameplay emphasizes emergent storytelling, negotiation, and calculated risk-taking, making it suitable for players who enjoy dynamic social interactions.</p>
                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>1、Story: The game takes place in "The Streets," a bustling yet dangerous urban district where underground trades and secret deals define the social order. As a mobster, each player must hustle their way to success, accumulating wealth while outmaneuvering rivals. The law is absent, and trust is a fragile currency. Only those who can deceive, strategize, and adapt will thrive in the cutthroat environment of Mob Street.</p>
                <p>2、Core mechanism: Players must complete three primary tasks to win:
                <p>   - Selling a product to another player;</p>
                <p>   - Buying a specific type of product from another player;</p>
                <p>   - Eliminating a designated target who is holding a particular item.To add tension, a new rule dictates that killing the wrong target will result in becoming "wanted"—marked by a blood footprint and hunted by all other players;</p>
                <p>3、Dynamic: </p>
                <p>   -  Social Negotiation: Players must convince others to trade with them, often through deception;</p>
                <p>   -  Hidden Information: Each player’s objectives are secret, leading to paranoia and double-crossing;</p>
                <p>   -  Risk vs. Reward: Eliminating a target must be done carefully, as mistakes can turn the hunter into the hunted;</p>
                <p>   -  Map Navigation: The subway system allows movement between two stations, creating opportunities for escape and pursuit;</p>
                <p>   -  Time Pressure: Rounds last 5-15 minutes, requiring players to make swift yet calculated moves.</p>
                <p>4、Art style: Mob Street features a gritty, stylized urban aesthetic reminiscent of noir crime films, with exaggerated character designs and a dark yet vibrant cityscape. The lighting and textures create an immersive, moody atmosphere that complements the theme of deception and survival;</p>
                <h2>Project plan</h2>
                <p>1、Prototyping: Core mechanics tested in a VRChat environment, refining interactions and player dynamics;</p>
                <p>2、Playtesting: Multiple rounds of player testing to evaluate balance, engagement, and potential exploits;</p>
                <p>3、Iteration: Based on feedback, adjusting mechanics, UI elements, and map design;</p>
                <p>4、Finalization: Polishing assets, optimizing performance, and preparing for public release.</p>

In a panic, he thinks of his grandfather telling him that there is a way to turn back the clock.
                      So he rushed home, found a time warp, and traveled back two hundred years. At this time, people were just starting to develop industry and cut down a lot of wood. Consumption had increased dramatically, and underground mineral deposits were being extensively mined and smelted, leading to deforestation,
                      climate warming and ozone depletion. Thinking of the impact all this would have, he resolved to do something to change the world.</p>

People with similar experiences and feelings are more likely to understand and empathize with each other, and are more able to speak to the
point and help to the point. Compared to men, women are generally more sensitive, more empathetic, more compassionate, and more likely

                <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
                <p>Facial expressions are an important communication tool for human beings. Through facial expressions, people can recognize the mental state of others, such as happiness, anger, sadness, etc. Facial emotion recognition (FER) is achieved by measuring changes in various body parameters, such as measuring heart rate, eye activity, EEG, etc., or by analyzing facial images. 
                   The latter is popular due to its abundant computational resources and cost-effectiveness. FER studies based on camera inputs can be divided into two groups, conventional methods and methods using neural networks. Conventional FER methods are based on hand-designed features to recognize facial emotions. 
                   The typical process involves detecting regions, extracting features, and then using a pre-trained classifier to recognize facial emotions. With the availability of large datasets, it has become a general approach for computer vision. In the published study, Kim et al. proposed a hybrid model consisting of CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) with the highest performance and accuracy of 78.61%. </p>

                <p>1、Methods：Convolution, Activation, Pooling, Batch Normalization, Dropout;</p>
                <p>2、Database：The Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) database，inlcuding 28709 training samples and 3589 validation samples;</p>
                <p>3、Results：</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1、Unbalanced data：Of the seven emotions, happy emotions accounted for the highest proportion, about 30% of the total sample. Disgusting emotions were relatively rare, accounting for only 3% of the total sample;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is performed using 10 epochs and performance is evaluated using a validation dataset. The overall accuracy of the trained CNN model is 65%;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2、Balanced data：</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.1、Random undersampling method：Achieved by imblearn API function RandomUnderSampler;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model requires about 40 epochs to converge, with an accuracy of about 40%, which is a 62.5% drop compared to the model using the original images;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.2、Random oversampling method：Achieved by imblearn API function RandomOverSampler;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model requires 5 epochs to converge, with a final accuracy of about 60%;</p>
                <p>4、Training with augmented data: as the input image changes in each epoch, the accuracy is close to 70% for 60 epochs.</p>

                <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
                <p>In this paper, I will use the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as my topic game. It is an open world action-adventure game jointly developed 
                by Monolith Soft and produced by Nintendo. The protagonist Link wakes up in the underground ruins on Hyrule land, chasing the incredible sounds and 
                embarking on an adventure. I will use Gee’s learning principles manipulation and distributed knowledge and cycle of expertise to demonstrate why 
                Zelda is a good video game and how this game can teach players how to play. Then I will support my thesis by referring the article “Play that can 
                Do Good” and Brown’s book Videogames and Education.</p>

                <p>1、James Paul Gee：Beyond characters, good games offer the player intricate, effective, and easy manipulation of the world’s objects, objects which become tools for carrying out the player’s goals; </p>
                <p>2、Adam Eichenbaum, Daphne Bavelier and C. Shawn Green：Creating an environment that encourages users to invest substantial amounts of time in learning and more hours spent on a task means more learning, and video game encourages players to put time in tasks;</p>
                <p>3、Harry J. Brown: Adventure games invite the player to inhabit an imaginary world and, in playing the game, ‘to enact an understanding of that world;</p>
